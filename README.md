# Storybook Component Library

### Description & Features

This component library was built using React and Storybook. The components were replicated from mockups using React. The components include buttons, checkboxes, a number counter, select inputs, text inputs (with and without accompanying buttons), and various thumbnails for listing products.

### Goals
I had a few goals for this project:
* Utilize React and Storybook to create a component library
* Recreate mockup components in an Adobe XD file

Future Improvements:
* Add more components to the library

### Example
Below is a screenshot of an example component in the Storybook library.
